#To-Do List
[DAY PASSING SYSTEM.]
UH, DO WHAT FOR DAYS TO PASS?
BATTLE MONSTERS?
WORK?
BOTH?
IDK.
oh. got it. every action takes hours from the day. when 24 hour passes from the actions taken day is passed.

[WORKING SYSTEM?]
press 1 to flip burgers
fight random monsters that... appear conviniently?
then give money to player when their done working
and give them experience for leveling up which is covered in the below subtopic

[SCHOOl? GYM? WATCH ANIME?]
lvl up stats after u do them and minus hour count per day

[LVLING UP SYSTEM]
grants 5 attribute points oor some shit like that, for every 20,40,60 and exponantionally increasing number of actions done u lvl up once.

[BUY STUFF FROM SOMEWHERE]
MONEY FOR SEX?
ITEMS LIKE FURNITURE FOR HIGHER (STAT:ENERGY) TO HAVE HOURS REDUCED FOR EVERY ACTION?
ok.
no sex yet. so
yeah basically
ITEMS FOR giving stats boosts for strength and intelligece and also u can upgrade the same items u got to give more stats boosts
than before. 
simple game ideas man.

[STATS]
(STRENGTH) for higher damage output against random stuff that attacks ur household for no apparent reason?
(INTELLIGENCE) for hitting on girls at work?
(WEABOOISM) for weaboo route?
(ENERGY) cuz its worth it to skill this stat right?

[WINNING CONDITION]
HAVing an action somehow that allows reduction of crime rate and world peace. Have a bar or something that appears every single action and day
for example action 1 : donate money to charity, cause you're soooo generous.
action 2 : go out and take things to your own hands and fight crime
